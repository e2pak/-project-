**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic we've covered has been shotgun metagenomic sequencing. From what I understand, shotgun sequencing may be more expensive than 16S sequencing, but it is more valuable for gaining information about microbial data when wanting to look at community-level analysis.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation, which was briefly brought up when discussing what to do for our Quarter 1 Project, that I would like to pursue is the "human microbiome aging clock", which includes the use of deep learning and feature importance to predict people's age based on their microbiome.

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
In our current Quarter 1 Project, we were split into two groups, both groups trying to reproduce/replicate the findings of their respective paper. However, both papers cover the same topic with the main difference being the model used. Therefore, my group is working on building an LSTM network and the other is working on building an attention-based network. A potential change I would have wanted to see is each group being assigned to different topics rather than the same one.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Our project's purpose is replication of a paper's findings so there is not any space to employ any techniques other than the ones used in the paper. However, I would be interested in seeing if we could improve the paper's model, and this might include hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, adjusting the architecture itself, etc.

In regards to the Quarter 2 project, I would be interested in learning about and utilizing more techniques specialized for dealing with microbiome data since classification of sequential data (which we do in our current Quarter 1 Project) is a relatively prevalent technique across different domains.
